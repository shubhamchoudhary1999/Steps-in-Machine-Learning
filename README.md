# Steps-in-Machine-Learning
#steps in machine learning #1.Import data often comes with csv file  #2.clean the data (remove missing or duplicate values)# EDA  #3.split the dataset into 2 sets training set and testing set  #e.g if we have 1000 pictures of cats and dogs we can reserve 80% for training and 20% for testing  #4.create a model  #This involves selecting an algorithm to analyze the data.so many mahine learning algorithms out there such as decision tress  #random forest,neural networks etc. #each algorithm has pros and cons in terms of acuuracy and performance. #Libraries out there that provides algorithms.one of most popular library is scikit-learn. #so build a model using these algorithms  #5.Train the model #method .fit(Training data) #we feed the training data to the model.model will learn the patterns in the data .  #6.make predictions   #.predict(Testing data) #eg.we ask the model is it a cat or dog if we come with a new image from the testing dataset and our model is then make  #predictions.predictions are not always accurate.  #7.Evaluate the predictions #in this step, evaluate the predictions and measure their accuracy.if accuracy  is low,then #we need to get back to our model and either select a different algorithm that is going  to produce a more accurate result for #the kind of problem we are solving or fine tune the parameters of oue model. #each algorithm has parameters(Hyperparameters) that we can modify to optimize the acccuracy.
